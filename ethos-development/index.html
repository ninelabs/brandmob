<p><strong>Think about this:</strong> If your brand was a person and they walked into a room, how would you describe them? What is the first impression you want your brand to convey? How would you describe them after knowing them for years? What kind of reputation would you like your brand to have?</p>
<p>How you communicate your brand and your values is part of everything you do. It's the cornerstone of your business strategy. The Brand Ethos Workshop distills your guiding principles down to a set of key traits that personify your brand.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the exercise, we’ve established the core rationale behind what your brand is and is not. The Brand Ethos guides future product and design decisions and is used as the foundation for Brand Naming & Identity projects. Messaging strategy, product positioning, and the company’s Mission, Vision, and Values are all directly derived from the Ethos.</p>
