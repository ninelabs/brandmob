<h3>Domain Name Availability</h3>
<p>We search every name candidate for top level domain name availability. The standard search includes .com, .net, .org, .co, .io, .us, and any ‘contextual suffixes’ (e.g. we would search .ly for the name “happily”). Additional top level domains can be screened at your request.</p>

<h3>Social Media Handles</h3>
<p>We search availability of each name candidate on the major social network platforms including Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, Snapchat, and any platforms specific to the industry or target market. Additional platforms can be screened at your request.</p>

<h3>Trademark Screening</h3>
<p>All names we present are prescreened against TESS, the US trademark database. Depending upon your needs, and at an additional cost, names can also be screened by trademark attorneys for availability worldwide or in the select countries that are of most concern to you. At the end of the project you should have your trademark attorney do a full trademark screen and application filing.</p>
