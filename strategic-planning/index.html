<h2>Stakeholder Interviews</h2>
<p>We will talk to a sample of your desired constituents to understand how they perceive your mission, and what types of concepts, imagery, and messaging evokes emotions and thoughts which align with your goals.</p>

<h3>Finding the North Star</h3>
<p>We meet with your team to discuss your goals and ambitions, and how we should best communicate your message to the public. We'll build a solid picture of who your target market is and your aspirations for connecting with them.</p>

<p>The next step is deciding what you want your new name to do for your marketing, branding and advertising efforts. Making this decision allows you to narrow your name search to one of the four major categories of names.</p>
