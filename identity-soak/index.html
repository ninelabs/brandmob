<p>As you might recall from the NameStorm Stage of the process, we suggest a passive activity called “The Soak”. This is a time when each of the participants in the process shifts from active thinking to passive thinking.</p>
<p>We recommend soaking on the identity candidate for 10 to 14 to allow the logo options to stay in the back of your minds while you go about your regular work.</p>
<p>This shift into ‘slow thinking’ always reveals new insights and understandings about the options, and has a significant impact on the effectiveness and quality of the resulting brand assets.</p>
